# TODO LIST

1. fa_define_query examples: remove if (FALSE) because they don't require internet to run
2. fa_define_query_range examples: no need for loop anymore (returns flight_results with merged data)
3. Update changelog for version 2.0.0...
4. For departure_datetime columns, can we get rid of the seconds somehow, since those will always be 0?
5. Clean README.Rmd to move all the "benefits" of package (e.g., usin Chromium) at the end, after demoing functionality.
