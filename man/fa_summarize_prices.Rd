\usage{
fa_summarize_prices(
  flight_results,
  include_comment = TRUE,
  currency_symbol = "$",

}
\arguments{
\item{flight_results}{Either:
- A data frame with columns: Date and Price (and optionally other filter columns)
- A flight_results object (from fa_fetch_flights with multiple origins)
- A list of flight queries (from fa_define_query_range with multiple origins)
- A single flight query (from fa_define_query_range with single origin)}

\item{include_comment}{Logical. If TRUE and Comment column exists, includes
it in the output. Default is TRUE.}

\item{currency_symbol}{Character. Currency symbol to use for formatting.
Default is "$".}

\item{round_prices}{Logical. If TRUE, rounds prices to nearest integer.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{time_min}{Character. Minimum departure time in "HH:MM" format (24-hour).
Filters flights departing at or after this time. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{time_max}{Character. Maximum departure time in "HH:MM" format (24-hour).
Filters flights departing at or before this time. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{airlines}{Character vector. Filter by specific airlines. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{price_min}{Numeric. Minimum price. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{price_max}{Numeric. Maximum price. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{travel_time_max}{Numeric or character. Maximum travel time.
If numeric, interpreted as hours. If character, use format "XX hr XX min".
Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{max_stops}{Integer. Maximum number of stops. Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{max_layover}{Character. Maximum layover time in format "XX hr XX min".
Default is NULL (no filter).}

\item{max_emissions}{Numeric. Maximum CO2 emissions in kg. Default is NULL (no filter).}
}
\value{
A wide data frame with columns: City, Origin, Comment (optional),
  one column per date with prices, and an Average_Price column.
}
\description{
Creates a wide summary table showing prices by city/airport and date,
with an average price column. When multiple flights exist for the same
date, uses the minimum (cheapest) price. This is useful for visualizing
price patterns across multiple dates and comparing different origin airports.
Supports filtering by various criteria such as departure time, airlines,
travel time, stops, and emissions.
