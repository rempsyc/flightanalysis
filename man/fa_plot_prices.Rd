fa_plot_prices(
  flight_results,
  plot_by = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  subtitle = NULL,
  size_by = "travel_time",
  annotate_col = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{flight_results}{A flight_results object from [fa_fetch_flights()].}

\item{plot_by}{Character. Specifies how to group the data: "origin" or "destination".
When NULL (default), automatically detected based on data structure. Required when
there are multiple origins AND multiple destinations.}

\item{title}{Character. Plot title. Default is NULL (auto-generated with flight context).}

\item{subtitle}{Character. Plot subtitle. Default is NULL (auto-generated with lowest price info).}

\item{size_by}{Character. Name of column from raw flight data to use for
point sizing. Can be "price", a column name like "travel_time",
or NULL for uniform sizing (default). When using a column name, only works when passing
raw flight data, not summary tables. Default is NULL.}

\item{annotate_col}{Character. Name of column from raw flight data to use for
point annotations (e.g., "travel_time", "num_stops"). Only works when passing
raw flight data, not summary tables. Default is NULL (no annotations).}

\item{use_ggrepel}{Logical. If TRUE, uses ggrepel for non-overlapping label
positioning (requires ggrepel package). If FALSE, labels are centered on points
and may overlap when there are many data points. Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_max_annotation}{Logical. If TRUE, adds a data-journalism-style
annotation for the maximum price with a horizontal bar and formatted price label.
The annotation is subtle and clean (no arrows or boxes). Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_min_annotation}{Logical. If TRUE, adds a data-journalism-style
annotation for the minimum price with a horizontal bar and formatted price label.
The annotation is subtle and clean (no arrows or boxes). Default is FALSE.}

\item{x_axis_angle}{Numeric. Angle in degrees to rotate x-axis labels for better
readability in wide figures with many dates. Common values are 45 (diagonal) or
90 (vertical). Default is 0 (horizontal labels).}

\item{drop_empty_dates}{Logical. If TRUE, removes dates that have no flight data
(all NA prices) from the plot. This is useful when querying multiple airports
where some may not have data for certain dates. Default is TRUE.}

\item{highlight_extremes}{Logical. If TRUE, highlights the lowest and highest
price points by filling them with distinct colorblind-friendly colors
(bluish green for lowest, vermillion for highest). Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{fa_summarize_prices}},
including \code{excluded_airports} to filter out specific airport codes.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot object that can be further customized or saved.
}
\description{
Creates a modern line plot showing price trends across dates for different
origins or destinations. The function automatically detects whether to group
by origin or destination based on the data structure:
\itemize{
  \item When there are multiple origins and a single destination, groups by origin
  \item When there is a single origin and multiple destinations, groups by destination
  \item When there are multiple origins AND multiple destinations, you must specify
    the \code{plot_by} parameter to choose which dimension to use for grouping
}

The legend title automatically updates to "Origin" or "Destination" accordingly.

Requires flight_results objects from \code{\link{fa_fetch_flights}}.
This function no longer accepts pre-summarized data or data frames.

Uses ggplot2 for a polished, publication-ready aesthetic with colorblind-friendly
colors and clear typography.

# Basic plot with auto-generated title and subtitle
fa_plot_prices(sample_flight_results)

# With point size based on travel time and annotations

# Size by number of stops

               size_by = "num_stops")

# With annotations centered on points (no ggrepel)

               size_by = "travel_time",
               annotate_col = "travel_time",
               use_ggrepel = FALSE)

# Custom title and both price annotations

# Tilt x-axis labels diagonally for wide figures
fa_plot_prices(sample_flight_results, x_axis_angle = 45)

# Default behavior: filter out dates with no flight data
# Set drop_empty_dates = FALSE to keep all dates including empty ones
fa_plot_prices(sample_flight_results, drop_empty_dates = FALSE)

# Disable highlighting of lowest/highest price points
