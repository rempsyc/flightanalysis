\item{title}{Character. Plot title. Default is "Flight Prices by Date".}

\item{subtitle}{Character. Plot subtitle. Default is NULL (auto-generated).}

\item{annotate_col}{Character. Name of column from raw flight data to use for
point annotations (e.g., "travel_time", "num_stops"). Only works when passing
raw flight data, not summary tables. Default is NULL (no annotations).}

}
\value{
A ggplot2 plot object that can be further customized or saved.
}
\description{
Creates a modern line plot showing price trends across dates for different origins/cities.
This visualizes the output from \code{\link{fa_summarize_prices}}, making it easy
to compare prices across dates and identify the best travel dates visually.
Point sizes vary inversely with price (cheaper flights = bigger points).

Uses ggplot2 for a polished, publication-ready aesthetic with colorblind-friendly
colors and clear typography.
